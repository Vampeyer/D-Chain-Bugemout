There is no repository found to refer to the DefualtPowerReduction. 

There has to be a repository that I have access to to help fix this. 
There has to be a repository for any developer to look at the code. 

That is why I am marking this as a high severity issue , because without 
a version controlled codebase , there is no source of truth for anyone to reference 
the said 

DefaultPowerReduction , method that is being described here .

I found some links online for similar issues , that may lead too resolutions here ,  

I will mark them in here  , as they are solutions to he issue in 
similar chains and should provide some assistance even without me being able to see the code.

*** It is important to note that in the repository above  , https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9447   

This is some description of  a the similar bug  , 
PowerReduction is now changed into an on-chain param. 
Updating it via a param change proposal is causing the consensus
 failure. It's occuring on a validator getting jailed once after
 the param is updated. Here's are the logs:


And a general comment on how that was resolved on their network. 
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9447#issuecomment-902203961




--- This suggests that there was a issue when it hits the staking store , ( on their version ) 
as it somehow takes a function that would then need to check and change every validators index , 
using the new power reduction value for each one . 

---- So i guess I should ask firstly here in your network ,  
is this a method thats controlled only client side , or server side  ? 

and are they fully synchronuizing easily ?

 I found another good few suggestions for the bug fix , 

 on the cosmos thread here ,

----- 
As the last one indicates that my questioning above
around the client and server handeling of the sync and updating  was correct. 



"DefaultPowerReduction is NOT on-chain param -- it's a constant. It's not meant to be changed.

If you do change it however, you are responsible for updating all validator's powers via the app's upgrade handler.
 I think EVMOS did this but I'm not sure. "
