This is a list of items needed in order to fulfill the need of simply testing a token on the testnet. 

I am using kepler wallet and metamask for testing , and brave browser for http / https endpoint testing, 
along with some network stats for each site listed.    


Broken links are a class of broken  
links with improper calculations for some required web services for the 
network, lead to broken networks , and are a crucial point of testing 
for the web3 developer.

Although somewhat trivial , the severity of these needs should not be neglected
for the health and progress of the network as a whole. 

It is my hope that these   

"mistakes"  , that "follow white paper calculations can be rewarded."  


Will be considered for processing of both a reward and a good break fix resolution ,  
as defined by the detials of the bug bounty.
