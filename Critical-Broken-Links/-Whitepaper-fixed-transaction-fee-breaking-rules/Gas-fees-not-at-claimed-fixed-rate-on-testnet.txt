On the whitepaper , it clearly states that the entire network , 
is to have a fixed transaction fee of 0.000000888 eth , thats six zeros , before 888. 


The entire tesstnet transaction ledger has not adhered to that ,

----------------------------------------------------------   


On this site , it clearly states the transaction fee , of each transaction , 
which is higher than the  , not limited , but fixed amount suggested by the whitepaper. 

This suggests that ( essentially all unless otherwise specified ,  ) 
 transactions , should be no more and no less than  
0.000000888 eth

On the testnet explorer , even the most recent transactions occuring here , 
https://dchaintestnet-2713017997578000-1.testnet.sagaexplorer.io/tx/0xa234e4271ac4e5a51fd3d04c36f3639fdc79a27dceb104a90dc2f5f597054919   


Have a Transaction fee that is much higher than the limit , for this one it is, 
a
Transaction fee of
0.00007168633330872 eth

________________________________________________________________________________________________






For each transaction that has happened upon the test ledger , 
that is  -  different - than the - fixed amount  - described in the whitepaper , 

I will be submitting a medium level bug request , as these inaccurate calcualtions are directly 
refelecting differently than the whitepaper , and I predict that they will continue to do so 
unless otherwise modified from here.    


Every transaction goes against the claimed fixed price on the whitepaper ,  
and every transaction that passes , is another that is higher that the claimed rate. 




Although , if every transaction is claimed as a bug , there should be easy resolution 
on customers , knowing there provider is adhering to their claims , ( I have seen the situation before.   )




------- 
Please excuse me  for not relisting and rewriting each one for each individual bug as that would be quite exhausting 

 

**** You may view the 50 transactions here , for which I am claiming 50 bugs on.
