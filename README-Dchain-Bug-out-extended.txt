--- So , First off , I cannot find a repository with public access for this referenced problem or isssue. 



I have looked all over the internet and I cannot find one  , 
so first , I will be submitting a high severity posting for the issue 
of the ability to resolve one of the needs in the  in scope criteria  , 

--- In order for me to possibly use this in scope criteria  , 

In-scope criteria
Help fix DefaultPowerReduction.

I HAVE to have a repository to work with and / or track issues in. 




--- That is the only way that me or any one can  - 
Help fix DefaultPowerReduction in a spefific repo , I have to see the code or a link to it easily. 
 , and be able to clone a copy to repeat the issue. 

-- This is in fact a complete requirement to help fix that issue ,   
- There has to be a codebase to reference , as a source of truth. 

and as such , I am marking it as the first high severity issue. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________






From here ,  

I will be making several folders , to each address and accurately 
define and reference each bug issue , as well as the expected result , 

Also , for each folder ,  a general severity issue reccomendation  , as  well as WHY I am 
labeling said issue at a specific level of severity for low to critical  functionality / need.
